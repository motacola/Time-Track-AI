## AI-Powered Timesheet Entry

This application uses AI (via Google's Gemini model) to process natural language input for timesheet entries, suggesting structured data like project, hours, date, and task type.

For detailed information on setting up the AI integration, including API key configuration, model details, and database considerations for the `task_type` field, please see:
